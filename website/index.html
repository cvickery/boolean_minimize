    <h1>Minimizing Boolean Functions</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="whitebox">

      <p>This document describes graphical and algebraic ways to minimize boolean functions. It
      includes <a href="#program">a Java program</a> that you can use to experiment with the
      algebraic algorithm outlined below. The subject of minimization is also covered in many
      textbooks, articles, and other web sites. Here are a few references:</p>

      <h3>Why Minimize?</h3>

      <p>All the datapath and control structures of a digital device can be represented as boolean
      functions, which take the general form:</p>

      <p class="indent"> <em>y&nbsp;=&nbsp;&Sigma;(x,&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;)</em> </p>

      <p>where &ldquo;<em>(x,&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;)</em>&rdquo; is a set of <em>boolean
      variables</em> (variables that may take on only the values zero and one). These boolean
      functions must be converted into logic networks in the most economical way possible. What
      qualifies as the &ldquo;most economical way possible&rdquo; varies, depending on whether the
      network is built using discrete gates, a programmable logic device with a fixed complement of
      gates available, or a fully-customized integrated circuit. But in all cases, minimization
      yields a network with as small a number of gates as possible, and with each gate as simple as
      possible.</p>

      <p>To appreciate the importance of minimization, consider the two networks in <strong>Figures
      1 </strong>and<strong> 2</strong>. Both behave exactly the same way!  No matter what pattern
      of ones and zeros you put into <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> in Fig. 1, the value it
      produces at <em>y</em> will be exactly matched if you put the same pattern of values into the
      corresponding inputs in Fig. 2. Yet the network in Fig. 2 uses far fewer gates, and the
      gates it uses are simpler (have smaller fan-ins) than the gates in Fig. 1. Clearly, the
      minimized circuit should be less expensive to build than the unminimized version. Although
      it is not true for Fig. 2, it is often the case that minimized networks will be faster
      (have fewer propagation delays) than unminimized networks.</p>

    <h2>Background and Terminology</h2>

    <div class="whitebox">
      <ul>

        <li>The variables in the expression on the right side of a boolean equation are the input
        wires to a logic network. The left side of a boolean equation is the output wire of the
        network.</li>

        <li>Any boolean equation or combinational logic network can be completely and exactly
        characterized by a <em>truth table</em>. A truth table lists every possible combination of
        values of the input variables, and the corresponding output value of the function for each
        combination. There are 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> rows in the truth table for a function or
        network with <em>n</em> input variables, so it isn&rsquo;t always practical to write out an
        entire truth table. But for relatively small values of <em>n</em>, a truth table provides
        a convenient way to describe the function or network&rsquo;s behavior exactly.

        <fieldset>
          <legend>Note</legend> <em>Always list the combinations of input values in binary counting
          order from top to bottom (&nbsp;000, 001, 010, 011,&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;).</em>
        </fieldset>

        </li>

        <li>Every row of a truth table with a one in the output column is called a <em>minterm</em>.
        A convenient way to represent a truth table is to treat each combination of input variables
        as a binary number and to list the numbers of the rows that are minterms.

        <p>This document uses the function with the following truth table as a running example:</p>

      <table class="truth">
        <colgroup class="tt_inputs" span="3"></colgroup>
        <colgroup class="tt_outputs" span="1"></colgroup>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">a</th>
          <th scope="col">b</th>
          <th scope="col">c</th>
          <th scope="col">Y</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td> <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td> <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td> <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td> <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td> <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td> <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td> <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td> <td>1</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

        <p>This truth table can also be represented as the list of minterms, [&nbsp;1, 2, 4, 5, 6,
        7&nbsp;]. That is, the truth table has a 1 in the Y column for the rows where the binary
        number represented by the values of a, b, and c is one of the numbers listed inside the
        square brackets. The other two rows (0 and 3) have a 0 in the Y column, and thus are not
        minterms.</p> </li>

        <li>One standard way to represent any boolean function is called &ldquo;sum of
        products&rdquo; (SOP) or, more formally, <em>disjunctive normal form</em>. In this form,
        the function is written as the logical OR (indicated by +) of a set of AND terms, one per
        minterm.

        <p>For example, the disjunctive normal form for our sample function would be:</p>
        <pre>
          Y = a'b'c + a'bc' + ab'c' + ab'c + abc' + abc
        </pre>

        <em>Note:</em> we also use the equivalent “overbar notation” for negation in places. The
        first term would be written as: <span class="overbar">a</span> <span
        class="overbar">b</span> c

        </li>

        <li>There is also a <em>conjunctive normal form,</em> which represents an expression as a
        product of sums rather than as a sum of products. The material presented below can be
        extended to deal with conjunctive normal forms rather than disjunctive normal forms.
        We&rsquo;ll leave that as as one of those classic &ldquo;exercises left for the
        student,&rdquo; and deal with just disjunctive normal forms.</li>

        <li>A <em>literal</em> is a variable that is either complemented or not in a product term.
        The minterms in our sample function have a total of six literals: a, a', b, b', c, and c'.
        The network in Figure 2 uses only 5 literals because a' isn&rsquo;t used. In the
        disjunctive normal form of a function, each product term has one literal for each
        variable. (6 literals for 3 variables in our example function.)</li>

        <li>Figure 1 implements our sample function, and demonstrates translating a disjunctive
        normal form function directly into a logic network. The translation procedure is as
        follows:

          <ol>

            <li>Use inverters to generate all possible literals (the six vertical wires on the left
            in Fig. 1).</li>

            <li>Draw an AND gate for each minterm. The fan-in (number of inputs) of each AND gate is
            equal to the number of input variables.</li>

            <li>Connect the outputs of all the AND gates to a single OR gate.</li>

            <li>Connect the inputs of each AND gate to a pattern of literals in such a way that it
            will generate a 1 when the pattern of input values matches the particular minterm
            assigned to it.</li>

          </ol> 
        </li>

        <li>A <em>minimal</em> form of a boolean expression is one which implements the expression
        with as few literals and product terms as possible. There may be more than one minimal
        form of an expression; if there is just one minimal form, that form is the
        <em>minimum.</em></li>

        <li>There are many rules for manipulating a boolean expression algebraically, but there is
        just one rule that you need in order to minimize a function once it is in disjunctive
        normal form: <em>the rule of complementation</em>.

        <p>The rule of complementation says that (x + x') is always true (1), so any two terms that
        are in the form (x + x')Y can be reduced to just Y without changing its meaning. Another
        way of saying this is that two product terms can be simplified if the only difference
        between them is the value of exactly one variable, in which case that variable can be
        eliminated from both terms to give an equivalent single term. For example ab'c + a'b'c is
        equivalent to (a + a')b'c, which is the same as the single product term, b'c.</p></li>

    </ul>

    </div>

    <h2>Karnaugh Maps</h2>

    <div class="whitebox">

      <p>A Karnaugh Map is a graphical way of minimizing a boolean
      expression based on the rule of complementation. It works well if
      there are 2, 3, or 4 variables, but gets messy or impossible to use
      for expressions with more variables than that.</p>

      <p>The idea behind a Karnaugh Map (Karnaugh, 1953) is to draw an
      expression&rsquo;s truth table as a matrix in such a way that each row
      and each column of the matrix puts minterms that differ in the value
      of a single variable adjacent to each other. Then, by grouping
      adjacent cells of the matrix, you can identify product terms that
      eliminate all complemented literals, resulting in a minimized version
      of the expression.</p>

      <p><strong>Figure 3</strong> shows how the minterms in truth tables
      are placed in a Karnaugh Map grid for both 3 and 4 variable
      expressions.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img alt="line drawing"  src="Figure_3.gif" />
        <p class="caption">Figure 3</p>
      </div>

      <p>Looking at the 3 variable map on the left in Fig. 3, note that
      minterm 0 (000<sub>2</sub>) is just above minterm 4
      (100<sub>2</sub>). This arrangement means that if both minterms 0 and
      4 occur in a function, the first variable (the one named <em>a</em> in
      Fig. 3) appears in both its true and complemented form, and can be
      eliminated. The top row of the Karnaugh Map is labeled with
      <em>a'</em> and the lower row with <em>a</em>: Any minterms appearing
      in the top row have the literal <em>a'</em> in them, and any minterms
      in the bottom row have the literal <em>a</em> in them. At the same
      time, note that each column has the same values for the variables
      <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>. Also, the columns are arranged in an order
      so that only one variable changes value as you go from one column to
      the next. Thus, the first two columns differ in the value of
      <em>c</em>, the second and third columns differ in the value of
      <em>b</em>, and the third and fourth columns differ in the value of
      <em>c</em> again. Furthermore, the first and fourth columns are
      &ldquo;next to&rdquo; each other as well, because they differ from
      each other just in the value of <em>b</em>.</p>

      <p>The right side of Figure 3 shows that this same pattern (adjacent
      <em>columns</em> differ by the value of a single variable) applies to
      the <em>rows</em> of a Karnaugh map too:  The first and second rows of
      that map differ in the value of <em>b</em>, the second and third
      differ in the value of <em>a</em>, the third and fourth differ in
      the value of <em>b</em>, and the first and fourth differ in the
      value of <em>a</em>.</p>

      <p><strong>Figure 4</strong> shows our sample function drawn as a
      Karnaugh Map. Minterms 1 and 2 are in the second and fourth columns
      of the top row, while minterms 4, 5, 7, and 6 appear from left to
      right in the four columns of the bottom row.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img alt="Truth table and Karnaugh Map" src="Figure_4.gif" />
        <p class="caption">Figure 4</p>
      </div>

      <p>A Karnaugh Map is used to produce a minimal sum of products
      implementation of an expression by drawing rectangles around groups
      of adjacent minterms in the map; each rectangle will correspond to
      one product term, and the full expression will be constructed as the
      OR (sum) of all the product terms. The goal is to have as few
      product terms as possible, which implies that each product term will
      account for as many minterms as possible.</p>

      <p>Here are the rules for drawing the rectangles:</p>

      <ul>

          <li>Every minterm must be inside at least one rectangle, but there
          must not be any zeros inside any rectangles.</li>

          <li>Every rectangle has to be as large as possible.</li>

          <li>Rectangles may wrap around to include cells in both the
          leftmost and rightmost columns. likewise for the top and bottom
          rows.</li>

          <li>The number of minterms enclosed in a rectangle must be a power
          of two (1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 minterms for 4-variable maps).</li>

          <li>Some functions have "don&rsquo;t care" conditions, which are
          combinations of inputs that will never occur, resulting in cases
          where it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the output is a zero or a
          one. Where these don&rsquo;t care conditions appear in a Karnaugh
          Map (usually indicated by X&rsquo;s instead of ones or zeros),
          they may be included inside rectangles or not depending on what
          will make the rectangles as few and as large as possible.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Figure 5</strong> shows the rectangles for our sample
      function, following the procedure outlined above:</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img  alt="Karnaugh Map for sample function" src="Figure_5.gif" />
        <p class="caption">Figure 5</p>
      </div>

      <p>The largest rectangle (the bottom row) corresponds to the product
      term <em>a</em>. By enclosing four minterms, two variables have
      been eliminated resulting in a single product term with a single
      variable. The rectangle in the second column encloses two minterms,
      eliminating one variable (<em>a</em>) from that product term. 
      Similarly, the rectangle in the fourth column eliminates <em>a</em>
      from that product term. The resulting sum of products function
      is:</p>


      <div class="whitebox">
        <p class="indent"><em>y&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b'c&nbsp;+&nbsp;bc'</em></p>
      </div>

      <p>If you examine Fig. 2, you will see that that logic network
      implements exactly this function.</p>

      <p>Every time you double the number of minterms inside a rectangle,
      you eliminate one variable from the resulting product term. Every
      doubling corresponds to applying the rule of complementation again. 
      The next section shows how to do the same thing algebraically.</p>

      <p>The <a
      href="http://www-ihs.theoinf.tu-ilmenau.de/~sane/projekte/karnaugh/embed_karnaugh.html">Interactive
      Karnaugh Map</a> mentioned at the beginning of this page is a very
      nice way to see how to draw the rectangles. You can enter the function
      you want to process algebraically, by editing a truth table, or just
      by clicking on cells in the Karnaugh Map itself. <strong>Figure
      6</strong> is a screen shot of the applet showing how it displays our
      sample function:</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img  alt="Karnaugh Map applet screen shot" src="Figure_6.png" />

    </div>

    <h2>Algebraic Minimization</h2>

    <div class="whitebox">
      <p>Minimizing an expression algebraically involves repeatedly
      applying the rule of complementation, starting with the disjunctive
      normal form of the function, and ending with a set of product terms
      called <em>prime implicants.</em>  A prime implicant is a product
      term that will generate ones only for combinations of inputs that
      are minterms of the disjunctive normal form of the function, and
      which cannot be further reduced by combining with any other term. 
      They correspond to the rectangles in a Karnaugh Map.</p>

      <p>We will call each step in this process a &ldquo;pass.&rdquo;  It
      takes two passes to minimize our sample function. The following chart
      shows the original disjunctive normal form of the function as
      &ldquo;Pass 0&rdquo; and shows what reductions are performed for the
      other two passes.</p>

    <div class="pre">
       ---------------------------------------------------------------
      | Pass 0:      a'b'c + a'bc' + ab'c' + ab'c + abc' + abc        |
       ---------------------------------------------------------------

       ---------------------------------------------------------------
      | Pass 1:      a'b'c + ab'c  reduces to b'c                     |
      |              a'bc' + abc'  reduces to bc'                     |
      |              ab'c  + ab'c' reduces to ab'                     |
      |              abc'  + abc   reduces to ab                      |
       ---------------------------------------------------------------
      |              b'c + bc' + ab' + ab                             |
       ---------------------------------------------------------------

       ---------------------------------------------------------------
      | Pass 2:      ab'   + ab   reduces to  a                       |
       ---------------------------------------------------------------
      |              a + b'c + bc'                                    |
       ---------------------------------------------------------------

    </div>

      <p>The rules to follow for each pass are:</p>

      <ul>

          <li>Each term present in one pass must be combined with another
          term if possible.</li>

          <li>Any terms that cannot be combined are carried forward
          unchanged to the next pass.</li>

          <li>A term that has already been used once in a pass should be
          used again if it will allow another term to be reduced. For
          example, in Pass 1 above, ab'c is used twice, and so is
          abc'.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>The rule about reusing terms in a pass corresponds to circling
      some minterms more than once in a Karnaugh Map. The two minterms
      that are reused in Pass 1 above are exactly the same two that are
      circled twice in the Karnaugh Map of Figure 5.</p>

      <p>Once the prime implicants of an expression have been determined, a
      minimal subset of them has to be selected. Picking a minimal subset
      of prime implicants relies on the notion of minterms being
      &ldquo;covered&rdquo; by prime implicants. For our sample function,
      the prime implicant <em>a</em> covers minterms 4, 5, 6, and 7; the
      prime implicant b'c covers minterms 1 and 5, and and the prime
      implicant bc' covers minterms 2 and 6. In this example, we need all
      three prime implicants in order to cover all the minterms at least
      once, and the expression shown at the end of Pass 2 is the minimized
      form for our sample function.</p>

      <p>But whenever there is more than one minimal form for an
      expression, the different forms will correspond to different subsets
      of the complete set of prime implicants. For any one of the minimal
      forms there will be extra prime implicants that have to be
      discarded.</p>

      <p>The following procedure describes a way to determine one minimal
      form of an expression after all the prime implicants have been
      determined.</p>

      <ul>

          <li>For every minterm that is covered by just one prime implicant,
          that prime implicant must be included in the minimal form. These
          minterms are called <em>essential prime implicants</em> because it
          is essential to include them in the minimization.

          <p>For our sample function, minterms 2, 3, and 4 are each covered
          by exactly one prime implicant, so all three of the prime
          implicants are essential, there is just one minimized form, and
          there is nothing more to do.</p> </li>

          <li>Make a list of all minterms that are not covered by any of the
          essential prime implicants.</li>

          <li>Make a list of unused prime implicants. Order this list by the
          number of literals each prime implicant contains.</li>

          <li>If any remaining minterms are covered by just one of the
          remaining prime implicants, the corresponding prime implicants must
          be added to the minimization, and all the minterms they cover must
          be removed from the list of uncovered minterms.</li>

          <li>If there are any uncovered minterms add the unused prime
          implicant with the smallest number of literals to the minimization,
          and remove all minterms that are covered by this prime implicant
          from the list of uncovered minterms.

          <p>If two or more prime implicants have equally small numbers of
          literals, there is more than one minimal solution. Finding them
          all involves systematically substituting each of the tied prime
          implicants into the different minimal forms being
          generated.</p></li>

          <li>Remove all prime implicants that fail to cover any of the
          remaining minterms from the list of unused prime implicants.</li>

          <li>Repeat the previous three steps until all minterms have been
          covered.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Disclaimer!</strong>  The algorithm given here is based on
      the Quine-McClusky &ldquo;chart&rdquo; method described in (McClusky,
      1965) and in (Kohavi, 1970). But it is not exactly the same as the
      procedure given in those references, and may not produce the same
      results. It should, however, produce a fully minimized function.</p>

    </div>

    <h2><a id="program">Minimization Program</a></h2>
    <div class="whitebox">

    <p>The code, including this website is available on <a
    href="https://github.com/cvickery/minimize">GitHub</a>, or you can download the executable Java
    jar file, which also contains the source code:

    <ul>

      <li><a href="./Minimize.jar">Minimize.jar</a>: The current version of the program. Requires
      JRE 1.5 or later. Includes source code.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>

      <p>The program allows you to enter either a boolean expression or a list of minterm numbers,
      and displays a series of messages that show the steps it followed to perform the
      minimization. Some expressions can be minimized more than one way, but the program shows just
      one minimization even if others are possible.</p>

    <h3>Running the Program</h3>
    <div class="whitebox">

      <h4>Graphical User Interface</h4>
      <p>Be sure you have installed the Java JRE, locate the copy of the Jar file, you downloaded
      above, and double-click on it&rsquo;s icon.</p>

      <p>In the window that opens, you may enter either a boolean expression or a list of minterm
      numbers in the entry field in the upper left corner of the window, and the minimized version
      of the expression will appear immediately below it. Do not use quotes for either type of
      input. Use single-letter variable names (case sensitive), * or nothing for AND,
      + for OR, ^ for XOR, and ' for postfix NOT. You may also use the boolean constants 0 and 1,
        and you may use parentheses to control evaluation order. When entering minterm numbers
        instead of an expression, use either spaces or commas to separate the numbers.</p>

      <p>When you enter an expression or minterm list, the minimized result of the algorithm appears
      immediately below the entry field. This string is automatically copied to the system
      clipboard and can be pasted into another application if desired. (There is no visual
      indication that the result string has been copied, but it <em>can</em> be pasted.)</p>

      <p>The Minterm Table immediately below the minimized result shows the minterms for the sum of
      products form of the expression you entered. The left column shows the product terms as truth
      table row numbers, and the right column shows the product terms algebraically. The Prime
      Implicant Table below that shows each minimized product term in the first column, and a list
      of the full product terms that each minimized term &ldquo;covers&rdquo; (implies) in the
      second column.</p>

      <p>The right side of the window shows the processing steps the program went through to do the
      minimization. (Or an error message if you entered an invalid expression.)  This is the
      information that is written to the console when you run either version of the program from
      the command line.</p>

      <p>Use the &ldquo;New Window&rdquo; button if you want to have multiple minimizations visible
      at the same time. The size, shape, and interior divisions of the last window you exit will be
      reused if you run the program again.</p>

      <p>You can also launch the graphical interface from the command line using the command,
      <em>java -jar Minimize.jar</em>.</p>

      <h4>Command Line version</h4>

    If you want to run the command line version, navigate to the directory with the Jar file, and
    type:</p>

      <div class="pre">
      java -cp Minimize.jar MinimizedTable <em> [-s] &lt;expression or minterm-list&gt;</em>
      </div>

      <p>The <code>-s</code> option makes the command run in “silent” mode. The only output will be
        the single minimized expression, with none of the intermediate processing steps displayed.
        This option lets the program be used to generate output to be used by other programs.</p>

      <p>You can enter either a boolean expression or a list of minterm numbers.</p>

      <p>If you enter an expression:</p>

      <ul>

          <li>Put quotes around the entire expression so that embedded spaces and other symbols such
          as asterisks will not be modified by the command interpreter.</li>

          <li>Use single letters for the variable names. Upper and lowercase letters are different
          variables. Don&rsquo;t use more than 31 different variables. (Your computer will
          undoubtedly run out of memory before you get close to this limit.)</li>

          <li>Use * for AND, + for inclusive OR, and ^ for exclusive OR. You can leave out the *'s.
          That is, ab is the same as a*b.</li>

          <li>Use ' for complementation <em>after</em> the item to be complemented.</li>

          <li>AND has precedence over OR and XOR. The latter two will be evaluated in right to left
          order. You can use parentheses to control the order of evaluation.</li>

          <li>Spaces have no effect.</li>

          <li>The constant literals 0 and 1 may be used.</li>

      </ul>

      <h4>If you use minterms</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>Do not enclose the list in quotes</li>
      <li>Separate the minterm number(s) with spaces. Do not use commas.</li>
      <li>The largest minterm number you supply will determine the number of variables in the
      expression and the number of rows in the resulting truth table.</li>
      <li>For example:</li>

      <div class="pre">
        java -cp Minimize.jar MinimizedTable 4 6
      </div>

      <p>There will have to be three variables and 8 rows in the truth table to include these two
      minterms. The variables will automatically be named a, b, and c.</p>
